# Staging TODO
### Codebase updates

+ Home navbar link item points to root url at "/" which currently returns a 404, route it to the blog or something for now 
+ "Contact navbar item" is a dead hyperlink, consider putting a minimally viable default like making it a "mailto:" url
+ Implement a default modal or similar that will alert the user that the feature they're attempting to access is currently under development.
